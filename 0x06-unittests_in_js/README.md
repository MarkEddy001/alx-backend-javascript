# 🎓 Unit Tests in JavaScript

Welcome to the Unit Tests in JavaScript project! This project is designed to help you master the art of writing unit tests using Mocha, Chai, and Sinon. By the end of this project, you'll be able to confidently write and run tests for your Node.js applications, ensuring your code is robust and reliable.

- Utilize different assertion libraries like Node's assert and Chai.
- Organize and present long test suites.
- Implement and use spies and stubs with Sinon.
- Write unit tests for asynchronous functions.
- Conduct integration tests with a small Node.js server.
