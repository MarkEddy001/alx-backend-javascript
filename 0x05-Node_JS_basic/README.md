# NodeJS Basics

## Description

This project covers the basics of NodeJS, including running JavaScript using NodeJS, using NodeJS modules, reading files, accessing command line arguments and the environment, creating HTTP servers using NodeJS and ExpressJS, and using ES6 with NodeJS. The project also includes tasks to create and manage a small HTTP server, both with NodeJS and ExpressJS, and to organize a complex HTTP server using ExpressJS.

- Use specific NodeJS modules to read files
- Use process to access command line arguments and the environment
- Create a small HTTP server using NodeJS
- Create a small HTTP server using ExpressJS
- Create advanced routes with ExpressJS
- Use ES6 with NodeJS with Babel-node
- Use Nodemon to develop faster
